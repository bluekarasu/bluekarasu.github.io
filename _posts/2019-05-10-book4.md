<h3 style="color:	#ff7400;">The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand</h3>
&nbsp; My second book of Ayn Rand . Because of my first career at Rakuten , my Indian mentors suggest me this to read . Everytime I read Ayn Rands book I feel like helpless in this world . When I read her books I always feel so hurt  because of overwhelming feelings of sadness , emptiness and anxiety .<br>
&nbsp; This book is about few characters with different personalities . Roark is an individualistic architect who always oppose society because they are all same . He really loves his job and his creativeness , he does not care about others and other things . He only wants to build with only his style . There is also , Keating who is exact opposite of Roark . He succeeds by following society styles but still empty inside and hates his job . And Toohey, everyone thinks he does not care and people respect him for that . But Toohey wants to be like King inside , and doing things to destroy Roark . Because Roark is not like others , Toohey does not like thinking man .There is also Roark's lover, Dominique Francon. She believes that non-conformity has no chance of winning, so she alternates between helping Roark and working to undermine him. I cant understand her . But I kind of liked her . So it does not matter . Also there is Wynand , kind of similar with Dominique and Roark . <br>
&nbsp; Anyway it was really great book to read . In life , I want to be like Roark . Do what I want and what I love . After too many difficulties and loses, he still manages to stand . He does not care who opposes him . He only wants to build ...
