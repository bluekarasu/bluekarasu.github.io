-For a majority of people,what they love exists only in imagination<br>
-It does not matter.Its all the same.<br>

<h4 style="color:	#ff7400;"> First book : The three body problem<br></h4>
&nbsp;I feel like this book is more like about human nature . And also every science concept in this book somehow makes sense to me . Almost all alien civilazation Science Fictions are about wars and territory . But this series is very different from them , It focus on science , psychology and possibility thats why this is my all time best...<br>
&nbsp;This series explores the world of Trisolarans(triple star system planet) . Trisolarans know someday they will extinct , because of their triple star solar systems . Triple star system cant be predicted (I searched it and it was true that no single equation can predict how three body bodies will move in relation to one another and whether their orbits will repeat or devolve into chaos) . So basically Trisolarans found earth because of some chinese scientist send radio waves to them. She found out that we can use Sun as amplifier og radio waves . After some years she receives alian message whatever .. I will stop spoiling now . From now I will only write about my feelings

<h4 style="color:	#ff7400;">Second book : Dark Forest</h4>
After reading Second book , I feel so so small .. Whatever happens I should be cool and calm , anyway I can do nothing . This book is about
losing a hope but still fighting for ourselves . Even after losing hope humans still try .

<h4 style="color:	#ff7400;">Third book :Dark Forest Theory</h4>
・All life desires to stay alive.<br>
・There is no way to know if other lifeforms can or will destroy you if given a chance.<br>
・Lacking assurances, the safest option for any species is to annihilate other life forms before they have a chance to do the same.<br>
&nbsp;I think peoples mind is so fucking beatiful especially writer of this book .
Our imagination has no limit  . If we can imagine there is possibility that  could be true .After reading 700 pages , I still wants to read . There are too many things that we don't know . Universal Law and Truth can be changed? or is it really universal???
